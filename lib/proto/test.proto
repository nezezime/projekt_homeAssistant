/* ABOUT PROTOCOL BUFFERS
* faster, more lightweight than XML
* Google uses protobuf as the basis for custom RPC system
* Code is generated using protoc compiler on .proto file
* Useful when language interoperability is required
* slower than thrift when not in speed mode cause the messages are smaller
*/

syntax = "proto2"; //proto3 has some odd tricks

/* CODE GENERATION
* protoc --proto_path=. --cpp_out=. test.proto
* . stands for current folder
* .proto file has to be given as the final argument
